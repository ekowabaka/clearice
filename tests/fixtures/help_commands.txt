Simple Wiki version 1.0
A sample or should I say dummy wiki app to help explain ClearIce. This app
practically does nothing.

Usage:
  test [input] [options]..

Commands:
init                initialize a directory with the source files of the wiki
generate            generate the data for a given directory and store it
                    somewhere cool
export              
help                displays specific help for any of the given commands.
                    Usage: test help [command]

Options:
  -v, --verbose              display more information
  -h, --help                 shows this help message

Hope you had a nice time learning about ClearIce. We're pretty sure your
cli apps would no longer be boring to work with.
