Simple Wiki version 1.0
A sample or should I say dummy wiki app to help explain ClearIce. This app
practically does nothing.

Usage:
  test.php [input] [options]..
  test.php [output] [options]..

  -i, --input=VALUE          specifies where the input files for the wiki are
                             found.
  -o, --output=VALUE         specifies where the wiki should be written to
  -v, --verbose              displays detailed information about everything
                             that happens
  -x, --create-default-index creates a default index page which lists all the
                             wiki pages in a sorted order
  -d, --some-very-long-option-indeed 
                             an uneccesarily long option which is meant to to
                             see if the wrapping of help lines actually works.
  -s                         a short option only
  --lone-long-option         a long option only
  -h, --help                 shows this help message

Hope you had a nice time learning about ClearIce. We're pretty sure your
cli apps would no longer be boring to work with.
