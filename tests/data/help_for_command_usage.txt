Simple Wiki version 1.0
A sample or should I say dummy wiki app to help explain ClearIce. This app
practically does nothing.

Usage:
  test generate --target=[TARGET]

Options for generate command:
  -t, --target=VALUE         specify where the generated wiki should be

Options:
  -v, --verbose              display more information
  -h, --help                 Shows this help message

Hope you had a nice time learning about ClearIce. We're pretty sure your
cli apps would no longer be boring to work with.
