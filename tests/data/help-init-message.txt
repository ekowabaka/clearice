Simple Wiki version 1.0
A sample or should I say dummy wiki app to help explain ClearIce. This app
practically does nothing.

Usage:
  app init [OPTIONS] ...

Options for init command:
  -d, --directory=VALUE      specify the directory to be initialized
  -t, --title=VALUE          title of the new wiki to be initialized

Options:
  -v, --verbose              display more information
  -h, --help                 display this help message

Hope you had a nice time learning about ClearIce. We're pretty sure your
cli apps would no longer be boring to work with.
