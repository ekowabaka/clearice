Simple Wiki version 1.0
A sample or should I say dummy wiki app to help explain ClearIce. This app
practically does nothing.

Usage:
  app [COMMAND] [OPTIONS] ...

Commands:
init                initialize a directory with the source files of the wiki
generate            generate the data for a given directory and store it
                    somewhere cool
export              export wiki to a different format
help                display help for any command. Usage: app help [command]

Options:
  -v, --verbose              display more information
  -h, --help                 display this help message

Hope you had a nice time learning about ClearIce. We're pretty sure your
cli apps would no longer be boring to work with.
