ClearIce is a library intended to help you supercharge your PHP CLI app development.
ClearIce helps PHP CLI applications to parse command line arguments which are 
presented in a style similar to what you would find in most GNU applications. 
It also allows you to perform simple I/O operations such as outputing text to standard
output (with the capability of controlling output verbosity levels) and reading input
from the standard input (with the capability of interactively validating input).
Another cool feature of ClearIce is that it can automatically generate help
texts for your apps.

Using ClearIce
--------------
If you manage your projects dependencies with composer then you can easily require
[ekowabaka/clearice](http://packagist.org/packages/ekowabaka/clearice) to have
clearice included in your application. 

To use clearice to parse command line arguments you can simply put ...

````php
<?php
require "vendor/autoload.php";
$options = \clearice\ClearIce::parse();
print_r($options);
````

in a file (which you can for example save as wiki.php). Then executing ...

    php wiki.php generate --input=/home/james --output=/var/www/cool-wiki

would produce ...

    Array
    (
        [input] => /home/james
        [output] => /var/www/cool-wiki
        [stand_alones] => Array
            (
                [0] => generate
            )

        [unknowns] => Array
            (
                [0] => input
                [1] => output
            )

    )

Form more information on how to use clearice you can read through the 
documentation. Happy programming ...

Features
--------
A summary of what ClearIce can currently do.
- Command line argument parsing.
- Command line argument validation.
- Support for grouping valid arguments under specific commands.
- Automatic generation of help messages
- Automatic instantiation of Command classes for CLI applications (Framework?)
- Interactive console I/O with input validation.
- Any other stuff I forgot to mention.

Road Map
--------
What I hope to see in ClearIce some time in the future:

- Colour output on the terminal.
- Correction and suggestion of mis-spelled commands.
- Shell TAB completion of commands and options.
- Use readline for reading console inputs.
- A whole lot of awesomeness!
